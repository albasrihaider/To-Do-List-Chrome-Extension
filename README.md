# To-Do-List-Chrome-Extension

A simple to-do list that stays open in the Google Chrome side panel while you browse.



## What it does

* **Stays open on the side:** The list stays visible in Chrome's side panel so you don't have to switch tabs.
* **Saves your data:** Your tasks are saved automatically. They will still be there if you close and reopen Chrome.
* **Basic task tools:** You can add new tasks, delete specific ones, or clear the whole list at once.
* **Simple icons:** Includes clean icons designed to look sharp in the browser toolbar.

2. Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (the switch in the top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where you saved the files.
5. Click the puzzle icon in Chrome and **Pin** Side Tasker to see it in your toolbar.
